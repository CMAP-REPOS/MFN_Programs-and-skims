c  Craig Heither, 10-31-2012: modified to add mf40 to hold truck skim distances
c  Craig Heither, 08-21-2015: modified so that mf40 now holds truck POE values (skimmed distances not actually needed)
c  Lafayette Cruise, 02-17-2016:created matrices mf43-52 to hold information for domestic distance matrices
c  Craig Heither, 06-17-2016: rename Egress time matrices to Auxiliary Transit Time (no longer egress only)
c  Craig Heither, 10-03-2016: add matrices mf 33 & 34 to store truck and water linehaul distances
c  Craig Heither, 05-16-2017: Aux. time for rail isn't needed: reuse matrices 3/7/11/15/19/23/27 for non-CMAP rail dwell time; add pipeline matrix storage
c  Craig Heither, 05-25-2017: Add matrices to skim all rail as integrated; include domestic pipeline distances
c  Craig Heither, 06-22-2017: Add mf80 to store LogNode (triple-index) for rail pass-through trips
c  Karly Cazzato, 01-07-2025: Remove unused matrices following updates (removed individual rail line skims and additional path variablity)
